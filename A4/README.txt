This is Version 11 (released November 7, 2020) of the support code
for Assignment 4 in CSE 473, University of Washington, Autumn 2020.

To start the GUI in a command-line environment, type the following,
in the same folder as the code.

python3 TOH_MDP.py

Some features of this version include the following.

--The user can only show a policy when it is safe (a policy can be
extracted), assuming your extract_policy methods work.

--Policy display is persistent with automatic updating whenever Q
values change.

--Independent policies are stored and displayed... one for VI and one
for QL.  This also means you can view both at the same time, in
different colors.
